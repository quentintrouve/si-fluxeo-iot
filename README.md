# Fluxeo - Smart Building and IOT

## üéì Disclaimer

This site has been created for educational purposes as part of the Bachelor's curriculum of the HETIC school. 
**This proof of concept was made using demo data that is no longer accessible. This data was provided by intelligent sensors that simulated the detection of people in a building. So the application is currently out of service.**

**Fluxeo** is a smart building application. Thanks to a system of detection of people within the floors and the different rooms, Fluxeo allows a better management of a building at the level of profitability, security, organization and sanitary. It's a Next.js project bootstrapped with `create-next-app` and using TypeScript. It's deployed on Vercel Platform.

Time to dev: **8 days**
